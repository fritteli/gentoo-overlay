*gitaly-0.3.0 (29 Mar 2017)

  29 Mar 2017; Manuel Friedli <manuel@fritteli.ch> +gitaly-0.3.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  www-servers/gitaly:  Added dummy-ebuild for gitaly-0.3.0. This will not build,
  but instead just show an error message upon installation. It is a mere
  placeholder for the future. It is needed so that the gitaly USE-flag could be
  added to the gitlab-ce-9.0.1 ebuild.
