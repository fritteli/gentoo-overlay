There are four ebuilds that have been removed from this overlay, as
they were very old and unmaintained. Namely, they are:
 - app-backup/duplicati
 - dev-java/nexus-oss-bin
 - net-im/palaver
 - net-im/punjab

Except for app-backup/duplicati, which has been superseded by
app-backup/duplicati-bin, there are no replacements for the ebuilds
in this overlay. If you're lucky, you'll find some ebuilds in another
overlay.

Thanks for your understanding,
