The dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner ebuild downloads the precompiled
binary and installs it. That's not the Gentoo Way Of Life. Therefore,
the existing ebuild is renamed to

    dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner-bin

and a new source based ebuild is introduced. The new ebuild will be
named

    dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner

so don't be confused.

Cheers,
fritteli.
