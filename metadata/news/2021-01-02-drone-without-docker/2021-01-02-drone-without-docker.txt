As of version 1.10.1, dev-util/drone is no longer started as a
docker container. Instead, it is built and run like an ordinary
application. Therefore, the configuration in /etc/drone/app.ini
needs to be adapted. Please refer to the official documentation.
Also, the comments in the aforementioned file might help.
