Upstream renamed gitlab-ci-multi-runner to gitlab-runner. We want to
follow upstream as closely as possible. Therefore:
- A new ebuild dev-vcs/gitlab-runner is introduced for versions
  >= 10.0.2.
- The old ebuilds (dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner) remain, but will
  probably not compile anymore, because the source files may have
  moved. Runner ebuilds for versions < 10.0.2 will consequently be
  removed from the overlay at some later point.
- The home directory is now at /var/lib/gitlab-runner instead of
  /opt/gitlab-ci-multi-runner. Please note that no files are moved
  from the old to the new location.

The new ebuilds will add a new user (gitlab_runner) to the system.
The old ebuilds used gitlab_ci_multi_runner as their user, which you
will have to remove by hand if you want to clean up.

There will be no automatic migration from the old to the new ebuild.

Have fun,
fritteli.
