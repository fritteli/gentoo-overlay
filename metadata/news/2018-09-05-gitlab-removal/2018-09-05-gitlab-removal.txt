The Gitlab CE ebuild, including its dependencies, is very much out of
date. As of this writing, the latest release is 11.2.3, yet the most
recent ebuild is still at 10.5.4.

Since I lack the time and infrastructure to keep up with the fast-paced
releases of Gitlab, I am forced to give up maintainership of those
ebuilds. As a consequence, the following ebuilds will be removed from
this overlay by November 1st, 2018:

 - dev-go/go-bindata
 - dev-go/gox
 - dev-go/iochan
 - dev-vcs/gitlab-ci-multi-runner
 - dev-vcs/gitlab-runner
 - dev-vcs/gitlab-shell
 - www-apps/gitlab-ce
 - www-servers/gitlab-gitaly
 - www-servers/gitlab-pages
 - www-servers/gitlab-workhorse

If you're looking for a resource-friendly alternative, why not try out
Gitea [1] in combination with Drone CI [2]?

Thanks for your understanding,
